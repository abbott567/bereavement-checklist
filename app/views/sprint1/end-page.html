          You don't need to do anything right now. The Bereavement Service will be
          in touch if any more information is needed for your application, eg to ask
          for a copy of your marriage certificate.
        </p>

        <p>
          If not, you will get a letter, email or phone call within 14 working days to
          let you know whether or not your claim has been successful.
