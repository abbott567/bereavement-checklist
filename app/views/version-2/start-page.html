          When someone dies, any State Pension, allowances or benefits they
          received will need to be cancelled.
        </p>

        <p>
          You'll need to give some details about the person who has died. This
          should only take a few minutes and will help to prevent overpayment of
          benefits and the fraudulent use of their identity documents.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you've finished, you'll be able to see which organisations have
          been contacted and what they will do with the information you provide.
          You'll also be able to find out about help with funeral costs or other
          benefits.

          You don't have to be the next of kin to give this information - but
          you must have their permission before you start. You'll also need their
          date of birth and contact details.
