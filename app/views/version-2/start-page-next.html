          There are some things you must do in the first few days after
          {{name}}'s death.
        </p>

        <p>
          You've already given his details and any benefits he received are now
          being stopped. Other things like his driving licence and passport are
          also being cancelled.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are now two things you must do:
            <ul class="list-bullet">
              <li>Register the death within 5 days (8 days in Scotland).
                Youâ€™ll then get the documents you need for the funeral</li>
              <li>Arrange the funeral</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          You can also get information on help with funeral costs or other
          benefits.
