          There are now two things you must do:
            <ul class="list-bullet">
              <li>Register the death within 5 days (8 days in Scotland).
                Youâ€™ll then get the documents you need for the funeral</li>
              <li>Arrange the funeral</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>

          This service can help you do both of these things. You'll also get
          information on where to find emotional support and help with funeral
          costs or other benefits.
