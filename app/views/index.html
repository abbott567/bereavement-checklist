          redesign of end page as users thought the journey was complete when they
          still needed to send their marriage certificates. Slight tweak to bank
          details page to include 'safe and secure' in the sidebar.

              In this version, inline with user research insights, we have removed the
              page asking about registering for child benefits. We have also split the
              contact details collection onto a page of its own. We also moved the
              collection of the partners details to the front of the journey, so the
              users felt it was important.

    					This is the first iteration of the prototype. We have encorporated three
              knockout questions to try and determine if the user is eligible for BSP.
              The journey ends where an agent will have to pick up the claim to gather
              evidence.

    				<p class="text">
    					This iteration has moved the eligibility questions into one page, and has
              moved the two questions around child benefit and dependent children into
              one page. This iteration also has 'full name' instead of seperate first
              name and last name.

    					This iteration has kept eligibility questions on one page from v2,
              but has kept the two step child-benefit process from v1. This iteration
              has a different exit journey, allowing the user to continue regardless
              of their eligibility.

        <p class="text">
          This prototype is to test the various ways people can supply their
          marriage certificates. Because only 20% of marriages can be automatically
          verified, we are exploring ways the user can get their certificates to
          us for that verification.

          This prototype is to test the journey for users who's partners may
          have worked abroad and payed into their social security scheme. The
          journey will change based on if you worked in a partnering EU country,
          so to view the entire journey choose countries such as Italy and Spain.
