              In this version, inline with user research insights, we have removed the
              page asking about registering for child benefits. We have also split the
              contact details collection onto a page of its own. We also moved the
              collection of the partners details to the front of the journey, so the
              users felt it was important.

    				<p class="text">
    					This is the first iteration of the prototype. We have encorporated three
              knockout questions to try and determine if the user is eligible for BSP.
              The journey ends where an agent will have to pick up the claim to gather
              evidence.

            <h4 class="heading-small">Version 2 - Grouped eligibility and child benefit</h4>
    				<p class="text">
    					This iteration has moved the eligibility questions into one page, and has
              moved the two questions around child benefit and dependent children into
              one page. This iteration also has 'full name' instead of seperate first
              name and last name.

    				<p class="text">
    					This iteration has kept eligibility questions on one page from v2,
              but has kept the two step child-benefit process from v1. This iteration
              has a different exit journey, allowing the user to continue regardless
              of their eligibility.
