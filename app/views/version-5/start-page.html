          When someone dies, any allowances or benefits they received will need
          to be cancelled.
        </p>

        <p>
          As soon as you can, you'll need to give some details about the person
          who has died. This will help to prevent overpayment of any benefits
          they received and fraudulent use of their identity.
        </p>

        <p>
          You'll be able to see which details will change before you confirm you
          are ready to pass this information on.
